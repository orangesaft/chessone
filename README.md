Knight Move Simulator

This program calculates the shortest way for a Knight from a point A to point B on a chess board.

1. The user inputs the starting point in a form of [#,#], and the ending point [#,#].
2. Then the program tries out all the possible routes and gives out the shortest route, and how many steps it takes.
